        This was a collaborative project where we came up with a design for a 
        light box. We considered the fact that it was going to change colors 
        and thought about a jellyfish. We wanted it to have an almost lava-lamp 
        feel to it and create a sense of depth with the borders. I made the 
        layers on Illustrator and then we laser cut it and assembled the pieces 
        together. We ended up slightly changing the original design when we were 
        gluing to make it seem like there was more movement happening.

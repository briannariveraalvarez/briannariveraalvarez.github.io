    <h2>Little Danny!</h2> 
    <iframe title="little danny" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/946428361?h=90ba48fef8" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"    allowfullscreen></iframe>
     <p>An animation project done on After Effects that portrays the main character, Little Danny, 
       on one of his many adventures where he successfully gets through all the different floors, 
       collecting coins and the key that unlocks the door to escape. He walks funny (it's his quirk) 
       and he has huge eyes. Each floor introduces him into a new world where he must then find the 
       next ladder to make his escape. When designing this in Illustrator, I knew I wanted every 
       floor to be very different to the previous floor so I was very particular about the colors I 
       used as well as the kind of design the floor would have.</p>

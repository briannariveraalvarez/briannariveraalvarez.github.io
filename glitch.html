              This is a glitched series where I glitched three pictures: a picture of a 
              little girl waiting for food, a man screaming and a protest. I specifically 
              picked these pictures to depict the children and adults in Gaza as well as 
              those who are standing with them in outside countries. I provided the 
              original picture as well as the final glitched products, please use the 
              slider to reveal them.  
                <br>

              <i> Glitching is not normal. It is a sign that something is wrong.</i>

                        <p>After glitching the original picture, I knew I wanted the 
                          focus to stay on the little girl so I did my best to not 
                          distort her too much. I was able to distort the color on 
                          her pink sweater that made her a little more vibrant 
                          helping bring more attention to her. 
                        </p>
                    
        
                    <h2>Red and Green</h2>
                    <img-comparison-slider width="90%">
     <img slot="first" src="glitch/man OG.jpg" width="100%"/>
      <img slot="second" src="glitch/man glitch.jpg" width="100%" />
    </img-comparison-slider>
                   <p>The glitches are mostly red, green and black, which actually happen 
                    to be the colors of the Palestinian flag. I copied and pasted the 
                    code that gave me those colors and was very particular about where 
                    I glitched out.</p> 
            
                    <h2>Palestine</h2>
                    <img-comparison-slider width="70%">
     <img slot="first" src="glitch/protest OG.jpg" width="100%"/>
      <img slot="second" src="glitch/protest glitch.jpg" width="100%"/>
    </img-comparison-slider>
                    <p> I wanted the final version to feel more intense and raw and I 
                      believe I was able to do that by completely changing the colors and 
                      glitching out the top of the photo. Red is tinting most of the 
                      picture which helps bring focus to the message on the protest signs, 
                      however I wanted the flag and the the countries name to jump out

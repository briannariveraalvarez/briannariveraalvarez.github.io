            <h2>Tofu Makeover</h2>

                I used Illustrator to give Nosoya's tofu brand a makeover. 
                Tofu Makeover is a vector illustration piece that completely 
                rebrands nasoya's Organic Tofu, America's number one selling 
                tofu brand. It presents itself with a different combination 
                of new fonts, less writing on the front, a new little tofu 
                character on the front and back of the package that I named 
                Toefee, and a tasty stir fry tofu recipe on the back. You do 
                not usually see a cute tofu character on tofu packaging which 
                is why I designed Toefee. I also thought about the fact that 
                there are a lot of people who do not know how to cook tofu, 
                which is why I included a stir fry tofu recipe in the back. I 
                like stir fried tofu.

    <h2>Dear Diary Tracklist</h2>
    <div class="divbycarter">
        <img src="photos/Dear_Diary.JPG" width="50%"> 
        <div class="textbycarter"> 
            The purpose is to share the names of the songs in Alex Sloan's Dear 
            Diary album to her audience. I used Photoshop to put this together 
            and took inspiration from the album's concept, that being feminine 
            with a dark twist. I blended different assets together to get the 
            final product I wanted and since the album is called Dear Diary, I 
            made the font look like handwriting.

        This was a collaborative project where we came up with a design for a 
        light box. We considered the fact that it was going to change colors 
        and thought about a jellyfish. We wanted it to have an almost lava-lamp 
        feel to it and create a sense of depth with the borders. I made the 
        layers on Illustrator and then we laser cut it and assembled the pieces 
        together. We ended up slightly changing the original design when we were 
        gluing to make it seem like there was more movement happening.

    <h2>Lovergirl Lyric Video</h2>
    <iframe title="lovergirl" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1066828601?h=1e36bdc46f" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"    allowfullscreen></iframe>
 <p>I used After Effects and Procreate to make this lyric music video. To me, this song feels 
   like something I would write in my Notes app; deep, gut wrenching thoughts and feelings. I 
   knew I wanted a pink color palette because to me everything about this song screams the 
   feminine experience or at least something that many women can relate to to some degree at 
   some point in their life. Pink is typically associated with femininity, I wanted to embrace 
   that. When I was younger I hated pink because it was seen as “girly” and “girly” was 
   typically associated with being “weak” and I hated that. As I have gotten older I have 
   embraced this love for pink and am more confident about who I am and what it means to <i>me</i> to 
   be a woman. So I embraced pink in this project and drew different hearts, eyes and fier to 
   depict the song in the way that I interpret it.

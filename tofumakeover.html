                I used Illustrator to give Nosoya's tofu brand a makeover. 
                Tofu Makeover is a vector illustration piece that completely 
                rebrands nasoya's Organic Tofu, America's number one selling 
                tofu brand. It presents itself with a different combination 
                of new fonts, less writing on the front, a new little tofu 
                character on the front and back of the package that I named 
                Toefee, and a tasty stir fry tofu recipe on the back. You do 
                not usually see a cute tofu character on tofu packaging which 
                is why I designed Toefee. I also thought about the fact that 
                there are a lot of people who do not know how to cook tofu, 
                which is why I included a stir fry tofu recipe in the back. I 
                like stir fried tofu.

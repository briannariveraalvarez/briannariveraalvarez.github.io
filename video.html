 <h2>Hollywood Monsters</h2>
    <iframe title="movie remix" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1066821608?h=f6989746ad" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"    allowfullscreen></iframe>
 <p>This is a movie remix with a couple of Hollywood's classic monsters: <i>Frakenstieins Bride</i>, 
   <i>Dracula</i>, <i>The Wolf Man</i>, and <i>The Creature from the Black Lagoon</i>. I enjoy watching 
   movies and I wanted to encapsulate the aesthetic and some of my favorite monsters from each movie. I 
   used <i> Blue Monday</i> by New Order and slowed it down to give this remix a unique feel and aimed to make 
   each cut not too predictable. I also had fun layering different clips on top of each other, kind of 
   like a collage. I used Premier Pro for this project.

 <h2>Look at me</h2>

 <p> This is a re-edit of the music video <i>Can't you see me?</i> by TOMORROW X TOGETHER that 
    was made on Premiere Pro.  I took clips from the video and replaced the song with a 
    different song that I believed held the chaos aspect of the original music video. I 
    wanted to expand on the chaos so I replaced it with <i>Cradles</i> by Sub Urban. Welcome 
    to my world of chaos. </p>
 
    <h2>Lovergirl Lyric Video</h2>
    <iframe title="lovergirl" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1066828601?h=1e36bdc46f" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"    allowfullscreen></iframe>
 <p>I used After Effects and Procreate to make this lyric music video. To me, this song feels 
   like something I would write in my Notes app; deep, gut wrenching thoughts and feelings. I 
   knew I wanted a pink color palette because to me everything about this song screams the 
   feminine experience or at least something that many women can relate to to some degree at 
   some point in their life. Pink is typically associated with femininity, I wanted to embrace 
   that. When I was younger I hated pink because it was seen as “girly” and “girly” was 
   typically associated with being “weak” and I hated that. As I have gotten older I have 
   embraced this love for pink and am more confident about who I am and what it means to <i>me</i> to 
   be a woman. So I embraced pink in this project and drew different hearts, eyes and fier to 
   depict the song in the way that I interpret it.

    <h2>Little Danny!</h2> 
   <iframe title="little danny" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/946428361?h=90ba48fef8" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"    allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>An animation project done on After Effects that portrays the main character, Little Danny, 
      on one of his many adventures where he successfully gets through all the different floors, 
      collecting coins and the key that unlocks the door to escape. He walks funny (it's his quirk) 
      and he has huge eyes. Each floor introduces him into a new world where he must then find the 
      next ladder to make his escape. When designing this in Illustrator, I knew I wanted every 
      floor to be very different to the previous floor so I was very particular about the colors I 
      used as well as the kind of design the floor would have.</p>
